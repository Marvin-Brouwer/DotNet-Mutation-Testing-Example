# Stryker example

This is a practical example explaining why having 100% code coverage doesn't mean your tests are good.  

## Running stryker

To make it easier on you we've added a bash script in the root that runs stryker for you.  
Just open the console in the root directory and run:

```sh
. stryker.bash
```

If you're on windows you can use the `git-bash` or `WSL` to run this bash.
